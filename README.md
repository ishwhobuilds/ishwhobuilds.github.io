## ✨ Overview

This repository contains the source code for my professional portfolio. It is designed to bridge the gap between complex research (LLMs, Agentic Systems) and production-ready implementation, showcasing expertise in:
- **Generative AI & LLMs** (Fine-tuning, RAG, Agentic Workflows)
- **Model Optimization** (PEFT, LoRA/QLoRA)
- **High-Performance Infrastructure** (AWS, GCP, NVIDIA A100/TPU clusters)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Structure**: Semantic HTML5
- **Styling**: Vanilla CSS3 (Custom Design System)
- **Interactions**: Lightweight Javascript (Smooth Scroll, IntersectionObserver)
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6.4
- **Typography**: Inter & Outfit (Google Fonts)

## 📂 Project Highlights

The portfolio spotlights four core pillars of my work:
1. **Python 3 Core Engine**: System design and automation.
2. **Model Fine-tuning**: Hands-on optimization with PEFT.
3. **Cyber Sentinel (MCP)**: AI-driven security automation.
4. **Agentic RAG**: Multi-step reasoning and graph-based memory.

## � Deployment

This portfolio is optimized for **GitHub Pages**.

1. **Fork/Clone** the repository.
2. Change the content in `index.html` to match your profile.
3. Deploy to `https://<username>.github.io/`.
